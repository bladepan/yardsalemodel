# Yard sale model
This repo is a recreation of the yard sale model mentioned in [Is Inequality Inevitable](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-inequality-inevitable/) article. Quoting the author here:

```
If you simulate this economy, a variant of the yard sale model, you will get a remarkable result: after a large number of transactions, one agent ends up as an “oligarch” holding practically all the wealth of the economy, and the other 999 end up with virtually nothing. It does not matter how much wealth people started with. It does not matter that all the coin flips were absolutely fair.
